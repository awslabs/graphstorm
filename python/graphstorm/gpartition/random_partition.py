    Single-instance random partitioning algorithm.

    The partition algorithm accepts the intermediate output from GraphStorm
    gs-processing which matches the requirements of the DGL distributed
    partitioning pipeline. It does random node assignments for each node
    during partition and outputs the node assignment results and partition
    metadata file to the provided output directory.
