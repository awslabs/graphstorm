To load a user-defined graph to GraphStorm, a user needs to provide a JSON file to describe
their data. Users need to store the node/edge data of different types in separate files.
The data associated
with a node/edge type can be stored in multiple files. Below shows an example of the graph
data with two node types and two edge types.

The documentation of the GConstruct module can be found at: https://github.com/awslabs/graphstorm/wiki/configuration-configuration-gconstruction
