To load a user-defined graph to GraphStorm, a user needs to provide a JSON file to describe
their data. Users need to store the node/edge data of different types in separate files.
The data associated
with a node/edge type can be stored in multiple files. Below shows an example of the graph
data with two node types and two edge types.

A tutorial for using your own data can be found at: https://graphstorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/own-data.html and GConstruct configuration is available at https://graphstorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration/configuration-gconstruction.html#configurations-gconstruction
