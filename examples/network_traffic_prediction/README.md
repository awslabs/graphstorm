# An Example for Air Transportation Traffic Prediction using GraphStorm APIs
This GraphStorm example demonstrates how to leverage the new feature released in v0.4, i.e., supporting edge features in GNN message passing computation, to perform a time serie prediction on an air transportation network.

This example uses a synthetic air transportation network, which can be generated by the `Synthetic_Airport_Traffic_wAirlines.ipynb` notebook. The synthetic dataset simulates a global air transportation network using major world airports, creating fictional airlines and flights with predefined capacities. The image below illustrates these major airports and the simulated flight routes derived from our synthetic data.

Users can play with the Jupyter notebook to see more details of the design ideas and data generation procedures.

Once the raw synthetic data, i.e., three parquet files, are generated, users can play with the `Air_Traffic_Data_Exp&Gc.ipynb` notebook to explore the data and construct the `config.json` file that will be used for graph construction for using GraphStorm. This notebook also run the GraphStorm's gconstruct command.

Using this synthetic dataset, this example performs a node time series prediction task, i.e., predicting the accumulated inventory amount in airports. Users can play with the `AirTrafficPrediction.ipynb` notebook to conduct the model training and inference pipeline. Because node time series prediction is out of the six tasks that GraphStorm currently supports, this example implements a custom GNN model that adopts the sliding-window strategy for time series prediction. For more details, users can check contents of the `nr_models.py` Python file.
