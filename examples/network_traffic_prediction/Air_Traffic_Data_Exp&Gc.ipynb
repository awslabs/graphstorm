    "# Air Traffic Input Data Epxloration and Graph Construction for Air Traffic Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook helps readers get better understanding of the input data format of the synthetic air transportation graph, and how it meets GraphStorm's graph construction command requirements. Readers should run the `Synthetic_Airport_Traffic_wAirlines.ipynb` first to generate the three parquet files that will be used in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "GraphStorm can handel experise-level graph data, measured in billions of nodes and tens of billions of edges. This synthetic air trasportation, however, is relatively small. Therefore we will use the `graphstorm.gconstruct.construct_graph` command that can run on a single machine. Details of the input data format can be found in GraphStorm's [Input Raw Data Specification](https://graphstorm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/graph-construction/raw_data.html) documentations. For large graph data that might consume more memory in multiple machines, readers can refer to GraphStorm's [Distributed Graph Construction\n",
