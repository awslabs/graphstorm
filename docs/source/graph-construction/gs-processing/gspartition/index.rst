Running partition jobs on AWS Infra
===================================

GraphStorm Distributed Graph Partition (GSPartition) allows users to do distributed partition on preprocessed graph data
prepared by :ref:`GSProcessing<gs-processing>`. To enable distributed training, the preprocessed input data must be converted to a partitioned graph representation.
GSPartition allows user to handle massive graph data in distributed clusters. GSPartition is built on top of the
dgl `distributed graph partitioning pipeline <https://docs.dgl.ai/en/latest/guide/distributed-preprocessing.html#distributed-graph-partitioning-pipeline>`_.

GSPartition consists of two steps: Graph Partitioning and Data Dispatching. Graph Partitioning step will assign each node to one partition
and save the results as a set of files called partition assignment. Data Dispatching step will physically partition the
graph data and dispatch them according to the partition assignment. It will generate the graph data in DGL format, ready for distributed training and inference.

Tutorials for GSPartition are specifically prepared based on AWS infrastructure,
i.e., `Amazon SageMaker <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/>`_ and `Amazon EC2 clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html>`_.
But, users can create your own clusters easily by following the GSPartition tutorial on Amazon EC2.

The first section includes instructions on how to run GSPartition on `Amazon SageMaker <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/>`_.
The second section includes instructions on how to run GSPartition on `Amazon EC2 clusters <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/clusters.html>`_.
