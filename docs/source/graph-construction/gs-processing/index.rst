Distributed Graph Construction
==============================

Beyond single-machine graph construction, distributed graph construction offers enhanced scalability
and efficiency. This process involves two main steps: GraphStorm Distributed Data Processing (GSProcessing)
and GraphStorm Distributed Data Partitioning (GPartition). The documentations of GPartition will be released soon.

The following sections provide guidance on doing distributed graph construction.
The first section details the execution environment setup for GSProcessing.
The second section offers examples on drafting a configuration file for a GSProcessing job.
The third section explains how to deploy your GSProcessing job with AWS infrastructure.
The final section shows an example to quick start GSProcessing.
