GraphStorm Configurations
============================

GraphStorm is designed for easy to use and requires less- or no-code operations for users to perform Graph Machine Learning (GML) tasks. In most cases, users only need to configure the parameters or arguments provided by GraphStorm to fulfill their GML tasks.

These configurations and arguments include:

- :ref:`GraphStorm graph construction configurations<configurations-gconstruction>`.
- :ref:`GraphStorm graph partition configurations<configurations-partition>`.
- :ref:`GraphStorm training and inference configurations<configurations-run>`.
