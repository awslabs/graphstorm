Running distributed processing jobs on AWS Infra
================================================

After successfully building the Docker image and pushing it to
`Amazon ECR <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ecr/>`_,
you can now initiate GSProcessing jobs with AWS resources.

We support running GSProcessing jobs on different AWS execution environments including:
`Amazon SageMaker <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/>`_,
`EMR Serverless <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-Serverless-UserGuide/emr-serverless.html>`_, and
`EMR on EC2 <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-what-is-emr.html>`_.
