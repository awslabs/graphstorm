Developer Guide
---------------

The project is set up using ``poetry`` to make easier for developers to
jump into the project.

The steps we recommend are:

Install JDK 8, 11
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PySpark requires a compatible Java installation to run, so
you will need to ensure your active JDK is using either
Java 8 or 11.

On MacOS you can do this using ``brew``:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install openjdk@11

On Linux it will depend on your distribution's package
manager. For Ubuntu you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

On Amazon Linux 2 you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install java-11-amazon-corretto-headless
    sudo yum install java-11-amazon-corretto-devel

Install ``pyenv``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``pyenv`` is a tool to manage multiple Python version installations. It
can be installed through the installer below on a Linux machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -L https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer/raw/master/bin/pyenv-installer | bash

or use ``brew`` on a Mac:

.. code-block:: bash

   brew update
   brew install pyenv

For more info on ``pyenv`` see `its documentation. <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_

Create a Python 3.9 env and activate it.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use Python 3.9 in our images so this most closely resembles the
execution environment on our Docker images that will be used for distributed
training.

.. code-block:: bash

   pyenv install 3.9
   pyenv global 3.9

..

   Note: We recommend not mixing up ``conda`` and ``pyenv``. When developing for
   this project, simply ``conda deactivate`` until there's no ``conda``
   env active (even ``base``) and just rely on ``pyenv`` and ``poetry`` to handle
   dependencies.

Install ``poetry``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``poetry`` is a dependency and build management system for Python. To install it
use:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -

Install dependencies through ``poetry``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now we are ready to install our dependencies through ``poetry``.

We have split the project dependencies into the “main” dependencies that
``poetry`` installs by default, and the ``dev`` dependency group that
installs that dependencies that are only needed to develop the library.

**On a POSIX system** (tested on Ubuntu, CentOS, MacOS) run:

.. code-block:: bash

   # Install all dependencies into local .venv
   poetry install --with dev

Once all dependencies are installed you should be able to run the unit
tests for the project and continue with development using:

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry run pytest ./graphstorm-processing/tests

You can also activate and use the virtual environment using:

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry shell
   # We're now using the graphstorm-processing-py3.9 env so we can just run
   pytest ./graphstorm-processing/tests

To learn more about ``poetry`` see its `documentation <https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/>`_

Use ``black`` to format code [optional]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ to
format code in this project. ``black`` is an opinionated formatter that
helps speed up development and code reviews. It is included in our
``dev`` dependencies so it will be installed along with the other dev
dependencies.

To use ``black`` in the project you can run (from the project's root,
same level as ``pyproject.toml``)

.. code-block:: bash

   # From the project's root directory, graphstorm-processing run:
   black .

To get a preview of the changes ``black`` would make you can use:

.. code-block:: bash

   black . --diff --color

You can auto-formatting with ``black`` to VSCode using the `Black
Formatter <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter>`__


Use mypy and pylint to lint code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We include the ``mypy`` and ``pylint`` linters as a dependency under the ``dev`` group
of dependencies. These linters perform static checks on your code and
can be used in a complimentary manner.

We recommend `using VSCode and enabling the mypy linter <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting#_general-settings>`_
to get in-editor annotations.

You can also lint the project code through:

.. code-block:: bash

   poetry run mypy ./graphstorm_processing

To learn more about ``mypy`` and how it can help development
`see its documentation <https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.


Our goal is to minimize ``mypy`` errors as much as possible for the
project. New code should be linted and not introduce additional mypy
errors. When necessary it's OK to use ``type: ignore`` to silence
``mypy`` errors inline, but this should be used sparingly.

As a project, GraphStorm requires a 10/10 pylint score, so
ensure your code conforms to the expectation by running

.. code-block:: bash

    pylint --rcfile=/path/to/graphstorm/tests/lint/pylintrc

on your code before commits. To make this easier we include
a pre-commit hook below.

Use a pre-commit hook to ensure ``black`` and ``pylint`` run before commits
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To make code formatting and ``pylint`` checks easier for graphstorm-processing
developers, we recommend using a pre-commit hook.

We include ``pre-commit`` in the project's ``dev`` dependencies, so once
you have activated the project's venv (``poetry shell``) you can just
create a file named ``.pre-commit-config.yaml`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # .pre-commit-config.yaml
    repos:
        - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
            rev: 23.7.0
            hooks:
            - id: black
                language_version: python3.9
                files: 'graphstorm_processing\/.*\.pyi?$|tests\/.*\.pyi?$|scripts\/.*\.pyi?$'
                exclude: 'python\/.*\.pyi'
        - repo: local
            hooks:
            - id: pylint
                name: pylint
                entry: pylint
                language: system
                types: [python]
                args:
                [
                    "--rcfile=./tests/lint/pylintrc"
                ]


And then run:

.. code-block:: bash

   pre-commit install

which will install the ``black`` and ``pylint`` hooks into your local repository and
ensure it runs before every commit.

.. note::

    The pre-commit hook will also apply to all commits you make to the root
    GraphStorm repository. Since Graphstorm doesn't use ``black``, you might
    want to remove the ``black`` hook. You can do so from the root repo
    using ``rm -rf .git/hooks``.

    Both projects use ``pylint`` to check Python files so we'd still recommend using
    that hook even if you're doing development for both GSProcessing and GraphStorm.
