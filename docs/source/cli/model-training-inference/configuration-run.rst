Model Training and Inference Configurations
===========================================

GraphStorm provides dozens of configurable parameters for users to control their training and inference tasks. This document provides detailed description of each configurable parameter. You can use YAML config file to define these parameters or you can use command line arguments to define and update these parameters. Specifically, GraphStorm parses yaml config file first. Then it parses arguments to overwrite parameters defined in the yaml file or add new parameters.

Launch Arguments
--------------------
GraphStorm's model training and inference CLIs (both task-specific and task-agnostic) have a set of parameters to control the behavior of training and inference.

- **workspace**: the folder where launch command assume all artifacts were saved. If the other parameters' file paths are relative paths, launch command will consider these files in the workspace.
- **part-config**: (**Required**) Path to a file containing graph partition configuration. The graph partition is generated by GraphStorm Partition tools. **HINT**: Use absolute path to avoid any path related problems. Otherwise, the file should be in workspace.
- **ip-config**: Path to a file containing IPs of instances in a distributed training/inference cluster. In the ip config file, each line stores one IP. This configuration is required only for model training and inference on distributed clusters. **HINT**: Use absolute path to avoid any path related problems. Otherwise, the file should be in workspace.
- **num-trainers**: The number of trainer processes per machine. Should >0.
- **num-servers**: The number of server processes per machine. Should >0.
- **num-samplers**: The number of sampler processes per trainer process. Should >=0.
- **num-server-threads**: The number of OMP threads in the server process. It should be small if server processes and trainer processes run on the same machine. Should >0. By default, it is 1.
- **ssh-port**: SSH port used by the host node to communicate with the other nodes in the cluster.
- **ssh-username**: Optional. When issuing commands (via ssh) to cluster, use the provided username in the ssh command.
- **graph-format**: The format of the graph structure of each partition. The allowed formats are csr, csc and coo. A user can specify multiple formats, separated by ",". For example, the graph format is "csr,csc".
- **cf** or **yaml-config-file**: (**Required**) Path to the YAML configuration file.
- **extra-envs**: Extra environment parameters need to be set. For example, you can set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and NCCL_DEBUG by adding:

    - --extra_envs LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    - --extra-envs LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    - NCCL_DEBUG=INFO
- **do-nid-remap**: Do GraphStorm node ID to Raw input node ID remapping for prediction results and node embeddings. Default is True.

..  note:: Below configurations can be set either in a YAML configuration file or be added as arguments of launch command.

Environment Configurations
----------------------------

Model Configurations
--------------------------------
GraphStorm provides a set of parameters to config the GNN model structure (input layer, gnn layer, decoder layer, etc)

- **model_encoder_type**: (**Required**) The Encoder module used to encode graph data. It can be a GNN encoder or a non-GNN encoder. A GNN encoder is composed of an input module, which encodes input node features, and a GNN module. A non-GNN encoder only contains an input module. GraphStorm supports five GNN encoders: `rgcn` which uses relational graph convolutional network as its GNN module, `rgat` which uses relational graph attention network as its GNN module, `sage` which uses GraphSage as its GNN module (only works with homogeneous graph), `gat` which uses graph attention network as its GNN module (only works with homogeneous graph) and `hgt` which uses heterogenous graph transformer as its GNN module. GraphStorm supports two non-GNN encoder: `lm` which requires each node type has and only has text features and uses language model, e.g., Bert, to encode these features and `mlp` which accepts various types of input node features (text feature, floating points and learnable embeddings) and finally uses an MLP to project these features into same dimension.

    - Yaml: ``model_encoder_type: rgcn``
    - Argument: ``--model-encoder-type rgcn``
    - Default value: This parameter must be provided by user.

It accepts two formats: a) `fname`, if a node has node features, the corresponding feature name will be fname; b) `ntype0:feat0 ntype1:featA ...`, different node types have different node feature name(s). In the example, "ntype0" has a node feature named "feat0" and "ntype1" has a node feature named "featA".

    - Yaml: ``node_feat_name:``
                | ``- "ntype1:featA,featB"``

    - Argument: ``--node-feat-name "ntype0:feat0 ntype1:featA,featB"``
    - Default value: If not provided, there will be no node features used by GraphStorm even graphs have node features attached.

    .. Note:: Characters ``:`` and white space are not allowed to be used in node feature names.  And in Yaml format, need to put each node's feature in a separated line that starts with a hyphon.

Early stop configurations
..........................
GraphStorm provides a set of parameters to control early stop of training. By default, GraphStorm finishes training after num_epochs. One can use early stop to exit model training earlier.

Every time evaluation is triggered, GraphStorm checks early stop criteria. For the rounds within early_stop_burnin_rounds evaluation calls, GraphStorm will not use early stop. After early_stop_burnin_rounds, GraphStorm decides if stop early based on the **early_stop_strategy**. There are two strategies: 1) **consecutive_increase**, early stop is triggered if the current validation score is lower than the average of the last **early_stop_rounds** validation scores and 2) **average_increase**, early stop is triggered if for the last **early_stop_rounds** consecutive steps, the validation scores are `decreasing`.

- **early_stop_burnin_rounds**: Burning period calls to start considering early stop.

    - Yaml: ``early_stop_burnin_rounds: 100``
    - Argument: ``--early-stop-burnin-rounds 100``
    - Default value: ``0.0``
- **early_stop_rounds**: The number of rounds for validation scores used to decide if early stop.

    - Yaml: ``use_early_stop: true``
    - Argument: ``--use-early-stop true``
    - Default value: ``false``

Model Evaluation Configurations
--------------------------------------------
GraphStorm provides a set of parameters to control model evaluation.

    - Argument: ``--eval-batch-size 1024``
    - Default value: 10000.

For node classification/regression and edge classification/regression tasks, if the evaluation set or testing set is small, mini-batch inference can be more efficient as it does not waste resources to compute node embeddings for nodes not used during inference. However, if the test set is large or the task is link prediction, full graph inference (set use_mini_batch_infer to false) is preferred, as it avoids recomputing node embeddings during inference.

    - Yaml: ``use_mini_batch_infer: false``
    - Argument: ``--use-mini-batch-infer false``
    - Default value: ``true``
- **eval_frequency**: The frequency of doing evaluation. GraphStorm trainers do evaluation at the end of each epoch. However, for large-scale graphs, training one epoch may take hundreds of thousands of iterations. One may want to do evaluations in the middle of an epoch. When eval_frequency is set, every **eval_frequency** iterations, the trainer will do evaluation once. The evaluation results can be printed and reported.

    - Yaml: ``eval_frequency: 10000``
    - Argument: ``--eval-frequency 10000``
    - Default value: ``sys.maxsize``. The system will not do evaluation.

    - Argument: ``--save-prediction-path /data/infer-output/predictions/``
    - Default value: If not provided, it will be the same as save_embed_path.

Node Classification/Regression Specific
.........................................
- **target_ntype**: The node type for prediction.

    - Yaml: ``target_ntype: movie``
    - Argument: ``--target-ntype movie``
    - Default value: For heterogeneous input graph, this parameter must be provided by the user. If not provided, GraphStorm will assume the input graph is a homogeneous graph and set ``target_ntype`` to "_N".

Edge Classification/Regression Specific
..........................................
- **target_etype**: The list of canonical edge types that will be added as training targets in edge classification/regression tasks, for example ``--train-etype query,clicks,asin`` or ``--train-etype query,clicks,asin query,search,asin``. A canonical edge type should be formatted as `src_node_type,relation_type,dst_node_type`. Currently, GraphStorm only supports single task edge classification/regression, i.e., it only accepts one canonical edge type.

    - Yaml: ``target_etype:``
           | ``- query,clicks,asin``
    - Argument: ``--target-etype query,clicks,asin``
    - Default value: For heterogeneous input graph, this parameter must be provided by the user. If not provided, GraphStorm will assume the input graph is a homogeneous graph and set ``target_etype`` to ("_N", "_E", "_N").
- **remove_target_edge_type**: When set to true, GraphStorm removes target_etype in message passing, i.e., any edge with target_etype will not be sampled during training and inference.

    - Yaml: ``remove_target_edge_type: false``
    - Argument: ``--remove-target-edge-type false``
    - Default value: ``true``
- **reverse_edge_types_map**: A list of reverse edge type info. Each edge type is in the following format: `head,relation,reverse_relation,tail`. For example: `["query,adds,rev-adds,asin", "query,clicks,rev-clicks,asin"]`. For edge classification/regression tasks, if **remove_target_edge_type** is set true and **reverse_edge_type_map** is provided, GraphStorm will remove both **target_etype** and the corresponding reverse edge type(s) in message passing. In certain cases, any edge with **target_etype** or reverse **target_etype** will not be sampled during training and inference. For link prediction tasks, if **exclude_training_targets** is set to ``true`` and **reverse_edge_type_map** is provided, GraphStorm will remove both target edges with **train_etype** and the corresponding reverse edges with the reverse edge types of **train_etype** in message passing. In contrast to edge classification/regression tasks, for link prediction tasks, GraphStorm only excludes specific edges instead of all edges with **target_etype** or reverse **target_etype** in message passing.

    - Yaml: ``reverse_edge_types_map:``
           | ``- query,adds,rev-adds,asin``

    - Argument: ``--decoder-edge-feat fanme`` or ``--decoder-edge-feat query,adds,asin:count,price``
    - Default value: ``None``
